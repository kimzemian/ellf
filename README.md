Models used to benchmark forecasting methods on social time-series dataset for Lead-Lag dynamics.

- partial repo, Time-MoE foundation model benchmarks are in another repository.

- to run transformer, MLP and LSTM models call `main_bench.py` with desired set of args. You will need to do some data preprocessing on the released data before running this, limited to change in names of extracting labels.

- the models are in baseline_models. Ignore train.py, this model is unrelated to the currrent released paper!

- will consolidate and add documentation if time permits!
